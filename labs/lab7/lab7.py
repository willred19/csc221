# Unit Testing
#
# In this lab you will be writing unit tests for the programming
# problems from Lab 5. The solutions are provided in:
#
# lab7_solution.py
#
# The problem is that each of the solutions has an error in it. Your
# unit tests should find these errors.



# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 1
# 
# Fix ducklings' names
# 
# In Robert McCloskey’s book Make Way for Ducklings, the names of the
# ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and
# Quack. This loop tries to output these names in order.
# 
# Of course, that’s not quite right because Ouack and Quack are
# misspelled. Can you fix it?
#



# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 2
# 
# Letter count
#
# Modify the count_letters function below so that:
#
# 1. It has two parameters: string and char
# 2. It implements the functionality specified in the comments
#
# Essentially, the function is returning the number of occurances of the
# parameter char in the parameter string.



# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 3
#
# Reversing a string
# 
# Complete the following function such that it reverses the parameter
# string.



# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 4
# 
# Checking for palindromes
# 
# Complete the following such that it correctly determines whether the
# given parameter, string, is a palindrome
#
